First of all, thank you and welcome to coming to this page.

# 1. Walk through
Here's how you must share your code on this repository. Before getting started, remember:
- Share only packages (don't upload entire workspace)

## 1.1 Demo
Here are the steps for uploading your package, but before getting started we assume that:
1. You have understanding of ROS concepts.
2. You have a package (say `test_echo_pkg`) that already has code in it.

Perform the following:
1. Copy the entire package into `packages` folder (/packages).
    ```
    cp -r test_echo_pkg ~/repos/github/6r_ros/packages/
    ```
2. Check the pull requests, add, commit and push. Branch is _getting-started_.
